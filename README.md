# 🚀 Sorting Program in C (QuickSort using `qsort`)

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains a simple C program that reads an array of integers, sorts them in ascending order using the built-in `qsort()` function, and prints the sorted array.

## 🔧 How It Works  
1. Reads an integer `n` (size of the array).  
2. Takes `n` integer inputs from the user.  
3. Uses `qsort()` from the C standard library to sort the array in **O(n log n)** time.  
4. Prints the sorted array.

## ⏳ Time & Space Complexity  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)` (due to QuickSort).  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(log n)` (recursion overhead of QuickSort).

- Happy Coding 🎯💡
