🚀 Sorting Program in C (QuickSort using qsort)

📌 Overview

This repository contains a simple C program that reads an array of integers, sorts them in ascending order using the built-in qsort() function, and prints the sorted array.

🔧 How It Works

Reads an integer n (size of the array).

Takes n integer inputs from the user.

Uses qsort() from the C standard library to sort the array in O(n log n) time.

Prints the sorted array.


⏳ Time & Space Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n log n) (due to QuickSort).

Space Complexity: O(log n) (recursion overhead of QuickSort).

Happy Coding! 🎯💡
